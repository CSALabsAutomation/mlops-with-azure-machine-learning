# MLOps with Azure Machine Learning

## What is MLOps?
MLOps is based on DevOps principles and practices that increase the efficiency of workflows. Examples include continuous integration, delivery, and deployment. MLOps applies these principles to the machine learning process, with the goal of:
- Faster experimentation and development of models.
- Faster deployment of models into production.
- Quality assurance and end-to-end lineage tracking.

## MLOps in Machine Learning
Machine Learning provides the following MLOps capabilities:
- Create reproducible machine learning pipelines. Use machine learning pipelines to define repeatable and reusable steps for your data preparation, training, and scoring processes.
- Create reusable software environments. Use these environments for training and deploying models.
- Register, package, and deploy models from anywhere. You can also track associated metadata required to use the model.
- Capture the governance data for the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle. The logged lineage information can include who is publishing models and why changes were made. It can also include when models were deployed or used in production.
- Notify and alert on events in the machine learning lifecycle. Event examples include experiment completion, model registration, model deployment, and data drift detection.
- Monitor machine learning applications for operational and machine learning-related issues. Compare model inputs between training and inference. Explore model-specific metrics. Provide monitoring and alerts on your machine learning infrastructure.
- Automate the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle with Machine Learning and Azure Pipelines. By using pipelines, you can frequently update models. You can also test new models. You can continually roll out new machine learning models alongside your other applications and services.
